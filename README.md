Day/Lesson #17 from [Wes Bos'](http://wesbos.com/) free [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course where you use vanilla JS

This lesson was a real challenge and my solution is downright embarassing. I did
stick with it though and got it to work but after watching the video of Wes
doing it with some `map()` calls my solution needs scrapped and re-done.
